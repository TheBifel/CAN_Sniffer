# BMW e90 Coolant Temperature Display with Arduino

This repository contains the code and documentation for a hobby project that uses an Arduino to monitor and display the coolant temperature of a BMW e90 in real-time. The project captures and decodes messages sent over the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus using an Arduino Nano and MCP2515 module, and displays the temperature on a 0.9-inch OLED display.

## Parts Used

The following parts were used for this project:

- 2 x Arduino Nano boards
- MCP2515 module
- 0.9-inch OLED display

These components were chosen for their affordability, availability, and compatibility with the project requirements. The Arduino Nano boards serve as the main microcontroller and interface with the CAN bus using the MCP2515 chip. The MCP2515 module acts as a CAN bus controller and allows the Arduino to communicate with the CAN bus. The 0.9-inch OLED display is used to display the coolant temperature in real-time.

## Future Work

In the future, the project may be expanded to include additional functionality related to the vehicle's performance and maintenance.
